Hi, i'm @Qynm and i'm from brazil. 
I'm interested in next.js because it adds a lot to my applications as a front-end programmer. I'm learning it right now and want to get a job to train it hard.
i want to collaborate in any applications that i can learn more and more of. And you can reach me on my e-mail zinumrfr@gmail.com. Thank you all
